PHD2's _Reverse Dec output after meridian flip_ setting depends on the mount model.  Here are the mounts that we know about.

If your mount is missing from the list, please run the Meridian Flip Calibration Tool (Tools > Calibrate meridian flip) and report your result in the [PHD2 Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/open-phd-guiding).
