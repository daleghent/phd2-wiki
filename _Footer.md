Approach #2: 

(This is from a Paramount ME-II owner using SGP and PHD2 with no issues, including functioning TPoint model and PEC turned on.

1.  In The Sky ASCOM driver I could never get DirectGuide to work and operate correctly, I run with "Enable Tracking Offsets" and "Enable PulseGuide" turned on

2.  For Plate Solving in SGP to work I have the "Sync Behavior" set to "Target Offset" this is necessary to prevent corrupting the TPoint model


Approach #3:

(from another user) Use poth [plain old telescope hub] and then have poth connect to tsx.  Then direct drive worked.
